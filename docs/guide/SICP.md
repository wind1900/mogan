# SICP Course for Beginners
The SICP course is designed for anyone with no programming background who is interested in Scheme and the essence of programming.

We expect readers to:
+ Have high school level mathematics and English foundation
+ Have basic knowledge of operating systems (Windows/macOS/Linux), able to open a terminal and use cd command to change directories

If you already know programming, the SICP course is still worth your time to watch and learn. You can use the exercises to determine if you can skip some of the lessons.
